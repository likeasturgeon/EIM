# EIM
Helpful scripts to automate common tasks relavant to Washington Department of Ecology's Environmental Information Management System (EIM). Currently, tools are in script format and may need to be re-customized. A future project could be to turn them into a set of functions that are part of an EIM package. EIM users, please contribute!
